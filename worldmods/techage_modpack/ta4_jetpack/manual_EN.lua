  "  - Craft TA4 Jetpack\\, Jetpack Controller and Training Mat\n"..
  "  - Use the armor extension (3d_armor) of the player menu to strap the Jetpack on your back\n"..
  "  - You can refuel the jetpack by left-clicking with the controller on a hydrogen tank\n"..
  "  - Turn the controller on by right-click and check the fuel tank level (the small colored bar below the controller icon)\n"..
  "  - Use the space bar to activate the Jetpack and the WASD keys to control the direction\n"..
  "  - Before your first flight you should do some training starts and landings on the Training Mat \n(The Jetpack is a bit stubborn\\, it takes some practice to keep the JetPack in the air)\n"..

  "  - 12 units of hydrogen are sufficient for a flight of 6 minutes\n"..
  "  - Maximum 99 items in your inventory are allowed including the controller.\nOtherwise you would be too heavy :-)\n"..
  "  - The Jetpack also wears out and can be used for approximately 10 flights\n"..
  "  - Always hold the controller tight during the flight\\, otherwise it will switch off :)\n"..
