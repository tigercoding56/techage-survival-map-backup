**A Jetpack for techage with hydrogen as fuel and TA4 recipe**

The Jetpack is inspired by the jetpack from spirit689 (https://github.com/spirit689/jetpack)
and by the historical game Lunar Lander.

Instructions:
- Craft TA4 Jetpack, Jetpack Controller and Training Mat
- Use the armor extension (3d_armor) of the player menu to strap the Jetpack on your back
- You can refuel the jetpack by left-clicking with the controller on a TA3/TA4 tank previously charged with hydrogen
- Turn the controller on by right-click and check the fuel tank level (the small colored bar below the controller icon)
- Use the space bar to activate the Jetpack and the WASD keys to control the direction
- Before your first flight you should do some training starts and landings on the Training Mat 
  (The Jetpack is a bit stubborn, it takes some practice to keep the JetPack in the air) 
  
Important to know:
- 12 units of hydrogen are sufficient for a flight of 6 minutes
- Maximum of 99 items in your inventory are allowed including the controller.
  Otherwise you would be too heavy :-)
- The Jetpack also wears out and can be used for approximately 10 flights
- Always hold the controller tight during the flight, otherwise it will switch off :)
